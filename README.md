# ANTI HAND Digital Mouse
This application was developed during my internship at Emeltek software company, application includes two different versions; 
First version is intended for use by individuals who are completely paralyzed and can only move their eyes. 
The second version is intended for use of the mouse only by disabled individuals who cannot use their hands.  
The app also includes additional small applications such as a virtual keyboard and voice command.

## First Version;

### Step 1; 
To ensure that the mouse moves in the direction the eye is looking.

### Step 2; 
To right-click the mouse, blink the right eye; to left-click, blink the left eye.

### Step 3; 
To use the mouse wheel (scroll key) downward, blink the left eye and then blink the right eye repeatedly. To use the mouse wheel (scroll key) upward, blink the right eye and then blink the left eye repeatedly.

### Step 4; 
In applications that require searching, such as Google, YouTube, etc., after clicking the search button and blinking the left eye twice, the virtual keyboard automatically opens, allowing the user to enter and search text using eye movements.

## Second Version;

### Step 1; 
Unlike version 1, in version 2, the mouse would track the user's face (the tip of the nose) rather than the user's eyes. This meant that the mouse would move in the direction the user turned their head on the screen.

### Step 2; 
In addition to the virtual keyboard used in version 1, voice commands were added because, unlike the paralyzed user, the user who can only use their hands can speak and thus is more user-friendly. The user first winks and clicks the search box where they want to type text. The voice command application then automatically opens and converts the user's commands into text.

### Step 3; 
In the application, both eyes are clicked once. If the head is up, the W key is pressed; if the head is down, the S key is pressed; if the head is to the right of the user, the D key is pressed; and if the head is to the left of the user, the A key is pressed; and if the head is in the center of the screen, the Space key is pressed.
This way, the user can play computer games without needing hands.
